How to run the code of this application?

If you are going from github first, fork and clone the project locally.

git clone <https://github.com/tcchawla/final-portfolio.git>
cd <project>

npm install
npm start

If you are going to run it through Docker, do following steps:
    Having project locally:
        docker compose up 
            OR
        docker build -t <image_name> .
        docker run --rm -it --name <container_name> -p 3000:80 -v $(pwd):/code <image_name>

    You want to run without having project locally:
        docker pull tarunchawla36/react-portfolio
        docker run --rm -it --name <container_name> -p 3000:80 -v $(pwd):/code tarunchawla36/react-portfolio
        
        OR
        
        docker run --name some-website -p 3000:80 -d tarunchawla36/react-portfolio go to https://localhost:3000/

Running this project is easy.
